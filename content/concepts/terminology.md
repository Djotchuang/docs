## Ocean Network

Any EVM-compatible network where Ocean [smart contracts](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-contracts) are deployed. There can be many Ocean networks and you can use the Ocean Protocol in several EVM-compatible networks, including:

- Ethereum Mainnet
- Ethereum [test networks](/concepts/testnets/)

## Asset or Data Asset

Anything that can be registered with and made available via an Ocean Network. Examples include data sets, trained model parameters, pipelines, and data-cleaning services.

## Data Owner or Data Service Provider

Someone who has assets that they want to sell. An example is an almond distributor with 30 years of data about almond sales.

> Initially, most data owners or data service providers will also be the publishers of their own assets.

## Publisher

A service which mediates access to assets on behalf of data owners or data service providers.

> Initially, most publishers will also be the owners of the assets they publish.

## Consumer

Someone who wants assets. An example is a data scientist working at an economic think tank.

## Marketplace

A service where publishers can list what assets they have, and consumers can see what's available then buy it (or get it for free). Every marketplace has a database where they store metadata about the assets they know about (but not the assets themselves). An Ocean network can support many marketplaces.
