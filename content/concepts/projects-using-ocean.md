## Using the Ocean Protocol stack

These are live projects that leverage core functionality of Ocean, such as reading or writing on Ocean datatokens or data pools. They don't rely on Ocean Market for an interface, by either having their own GUI or CLI, or using another app.

## Using OCEAN

These projects use just the Ocean Token, but do more than just exchanging it. This includes staking, and liquidity mining opportunities.
