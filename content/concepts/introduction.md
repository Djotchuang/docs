---

In Ocean Protocol, each data service gets its own **datatoken**. This enables data wallets, data exchanges, and data co-ops by directly leveraging crypto wallets, exchanges, and more.

Ocean Protocol provides tools for developers to build data marketplaces, and to manage datatokens for use in DeFi.

## Build Data Markets

Use Ocean Protocol software tools to build your own data marketplace, by either forking [Ocean Market](https://market.oceanprotocol.com/) code or building up with Ocean components.

## Manage ERC20 Data Assets for use in DeFi

Use Ocean [JavaScript](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-lib-js) or [Python](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/squid-py) drivers to manage datatokens:

- Publish and consume data services: downloadable files or compute-to-data. Use Ocean to deploy a new [ERC20](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/7f4f0377730f5fc266824084188cc17cf246932e/EIPS/eip-20.md) datatoken contract for each data service, then mint datatokens.

- Transfer datatokens to another owner (or approve & transferFrom).

- Manage pools. Deploy OCEAN-datatoken [Balancer](https://www.balancer.finance/) pools, buy & sell datatokens (swap), and add & remove liquidity.

- And more. Use ERC20 support in [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/), [web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples.html#working-with-an-erc20-token-contract) and Solidity to connect datatokens with crypto wallets and other DeFi services.
