## Basics

**Ocean Tokens** are the [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) associated with Ocean Protocol. They are standards-compliant [ERC-20 tokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERC-20).

Property               | Value
-----------------------|---------
Token Contract Address | [See the tutorial](/tutorials/wallets-and-ocean-tokens/)
Token Symbol           | OCEAN
Decimals of Precision  | 18

## Testnet Ocean Tokens

There are Ocean Tokens in several testnets, including the Kovan testnet and Nile testnet. They are just testnet Ocean Tokens (i.e. for testing purposes only) and they aren't interchangeable with Mainnet Ocean Tokens. For more details, see the the [page about Testnets](/concepts/testnets/) and the [tutorials](/tutorials/introduction/).

## Mainnet Ocean Tokens

**NOTICE: Below we outline the plans for Mainnet Ocean Tokens at the time of writing. Those plans might change. We try to keep this page up-to-date but there may be some delay.**

The initial circulating supply of Mainnet Ocean Tokens will first become available on the Ethereum Mainnet (_not_ the Ocean Mainnet).

If you acquired Ocean Tokens in the initial circulating supply, they will be sent to the address you provided.

In the future, the Ocean Mainnet will be launched and later it will become possible to move Ocean Tokens from the Ethereum Mainnet to the Ocean Mainnet.

It _won't_ be possible to use Mainnet Ocean Tokens for Ocean Protocol tasks (such as consuming assets) in the Ethereum Mainnet. It _will_ be possible to use Mainnet Ocean Tokens for Ocean Protocol tasks in the Ocean Mainnet.
