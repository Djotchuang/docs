## Basics

**Ocean Tokens** are the [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) associated with Ocean Protocol. They are standards-compliant [ERC-20 tokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERC-20).

Property               | Value
-----------------------|---------
Token Contract Address | See below
Token Symbol           | OCEAN
Decimals of Precision  | 18

## Testnet Ocean Tokens

There are Ocean Tokens in several testnets, including the Kovan testnet and Nile testnet. They are just testnet Ocean Tokens (i.e. for testing purposes only) and they aren't interchangeable with Mainnet Ocean Tokens. For more details (including token contract addresses), see the the [page about Testnets](/concepts/testnets/).

## Mainnet Ocean Tokens

The initial circulating supply of Mainnet Ocean Tokens will first become available on the Ethereum mainnet (_not_ the Ocean mainnet).

**Ethereum Mainnet Token Contract Address:** To be determined

If you acquired Ocean Tokens in the initial circulating supply, they will be sent to the address you provided. We will write about the timing and other details elsewhere.

In the future, the Ocean mainnet will be launched and later it will become possible to move Ocean Tokens from the Ethereum mainnet to the Ocean mainnet. We will write about the timing and other details elsewhere.

It _won't_ be possible to use Mainnet Ocean Tokens for Ocean Protocol tasks (such as consuming assets) in the Ethereum mainnet. It _will_ be possible to use Mainnet Ocean Tokens for Ocean Protocol tasks in the Ocean mainnet.
