## Basics

**Ocean Tokens** are the [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) associated with Ocean Protocol. They are standards-compliant [ERC-20 tokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERC-20).

| Property               | Value                                                    |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Token Contract Address | [See the tutorial](/tutorials/wallets-and-ocean-tokens/) |
| Token Symbol           | OCEAN                                                    |
| Decimals of Precision  | 18                                                       |

## Testnet Ocean Tokens

There are Ocean Tokens in several testnets, including the Kovan testnet and Nile testnet. They are just testnet Ocean Tokens (i.e. for testing purposes only) and they aren't interchangeable with Ethereum Mainnet Ocean Tokens. For more details, see the the [page about Testnets](/concepts/testnets/) and the [tutorials](/tutorials/introduction/).

## Ocean Tokens in the Ethereum Mainnet and the Ocean Production Network

**NOTICE: Below we outline plans at the time of writing. Those plans might change. We will update this page on a regular basis.**

The initial circulating supply of Ethereum Mainnet Ocean Tokens became available on the Ethereum Mainnet (_not_ the [Ocean Production Network](/concepts/production-network/)) in May 2019.

If you acquired Ocean Tokens in the initial circulating supply, they should have been, or will be, sent to the address you provided, in the Ethereum Mainnet.

In the future, the [Ocean Production Network](/concepts/production-network/) will be launched and later it will become possible to move Ocean Tokens from the Ethereum Mainnet to the Ocean Production Network.

At the time of writing, Ethereum Mainnet Ocean Tokens could not be used for Ocean Protocol tasks (such as purchasing a data set) in the Ethereum Mainnet.
