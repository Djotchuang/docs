## Basics

**Ocean Tokens** are the [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) associated with Ocean Protocol. They are standards-compliant [ERC-20 tokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERC-20).

Property               | Value
-----------------------|---------
Token Contract Address | See below
Token Symbol           | OCEAN
Decimals of Precision  | 18
Total Token Supply     | 1,410,000,000 (not counting testnet tokens)

## Testnet Ocean Tokens

There are Ocean Tokens in several testnets, including the Kovan testnet and Nile testnet. They are just testnet Ocean Tokens (i.e. for testing purposes only) and they aren't interchangeable with Mainnet Ocean Tokens. For more details (including token contract addresses), see the the [page about Testnets](/concepts/testnets/).

## Mainnet Ocean Tokens

The initial circulating supply of Mainnet Ocean Tokens will become available on the Ethereum mainnet in April 2019.

**Ethereum Mainnet Token Contract Address:** To be determined

If you acquired Ocean Tokens before the Ocean mainnet launch (e.g. in the seed round, in the pre-sale, in the token sale, or some other way), then your Ocean Tokens will be sent to the address you provided (in the Ethereum mainnet).

In the future, the Ocean mainnet will be launched and it will become possible to move Ocean Tokens from the Ethereum mainnet to the Ocean mainnet. The details are to be determined.

Also in the future (but not necessarily at the same time), it will become possible to earn new Mainnet Ocean Tokens as network rewards. The [Ocean Protocol Technical Whitepaper](https://oceanprotocol.com/tech-whitepaper.pdf) explains that in more detail.

Note: It won't be possible to _use_ Mainnet Ocean Tokens for Ocean Protocol tasks (such as consuming an asset) in the Ethereum mainnet. In fact, most of the Ocean Protocol keeper contracts (smart contracts) won't be deployed to the Ethereum mainnet. Mainnet Ocean Tokens will only be usable for doing Ocean Protocol tasks in the Ocean mainnet.
