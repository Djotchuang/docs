title: Get ETH and OCEAN Tokens
description: How to get tokens for each network
---

## Overview

In each network, you'll need ETH to pay for gas, and OCEAN for certain Ocean actions.

Ethereum mainnet is a network for production settings. Accordingly, ETH and OCEAN tokens have _real_ value.

Other networks are test networks. The ETH and OCEAN tokens in each of these networks don't have real value. The tokens are simply stand-ins to be able to test. They have "faucets" to dole out ETH and OCEAN. 

## Ethereum mainnet

- **ETH** [Exchanges to purchase ETH](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum#markets). 

- **OCEAN** [Official exchanges to purchase OCEAN](https://oceanprotocol.com/token#get).


## Rinkeby testnet

- **ETH** [ETH faucet for Rinkeby](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/). You may find others by [searching](https://www.google.com/search?q=rinkeby+ether+faucet&oq=rinkeby+ether+faucet).

- **OCEAN** [OCEAN faucet for Rinkeby](https://faucet.rinkeby.oceanprotocol.com).

## Ropsten testnet

Ropsten has a faucet to dole out ETH, and another for OCEAN.

- **ETH** [ETH faucet for Ropsten](https://faucet.dimensions.network/). You may find others by [searching](https://www.google.com/search?q=ropsten+ether+faucet&oq=ropsten+ether+faucet).

- **OCEAN** [OCEAN faucet for Ropsten](https://faucet.ropsten.oceanprotocol.com).

## Local network

Ganache is a local test network. 

- **ETH.** By default, Ganache creates several Ethereum accounts at launch, gives each some ETH, and makes their private keys available in the logs. You can also instruct Ganache to give ETH to specific Ethereum addresses.

- **OCEAN.** You can deploy an ERC20 token with label OCEAN. You'll see examples in the quickstarts for the Ocean JavaScript and Python drivers.
