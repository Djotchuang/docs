### Help develop Ocean core software

We'd love to have you help contribute to the Ocean core software! Here are ways to get going:

- _Just do it:)_ Branch from the code, improve it, submit a Pull Request.
- Chat with other Ocean developers in [Discord](https://discord.gg/TnXjkR5).
- Because of the weird world of intellectual property, before it can go through, we need to follow the [legal requirements](/concepts/legal-reqs/). Please be aware of this.
- Finally, here's the [Contributor Code of Conduct](/concepts/code-of-conduct/).

### Develop an app or integration, using Ocean as a tool

Integrate Ocean at one of its interface points: React hooks, Javascript library, Python library, smart contracts, etc.

Ocean documentation will help. And... you're here:)

### Report a bug

To report a vulnerability, [go here](/concepts/vulnerabilities/).

To report a bug that isn't a vulnerability, go to the relevant GitHub repository, click on the Issues tab, click on the New issue button, and read the instructions.

### Improve these docs

These docs can always be improved. Here's the repo.
<repo name="docs"></repo>

### Other ways to get involved

Please go to the [Ocean Community Page](https://www.oceanprotocol.com/community) for more ideas on how to get involved.
