## Core software

We'd love to have you help contribute to any repository within the `oceanprotocol` GitHub organization!

Before you start coding right away, please follow those basic guidelines:

- Search existing open and closed issues and PRs if you want to fix a bug or add a new feature to see if something is or has been already reported or worked on.
- Before starting to add features, please open an issue first so it can be discussed.
- Make yourself familiar with eventual repository-specific contribution requirements.
- Because of the weird world of intellectual property, we need you to follow the [legal requirements](/concepts/legal-reqs/) for contributing code.
- Be excellent to each other, as outlined in our [Contributor Code of Conduct](/concepts/code-of-conduct/).

### Workflow

A typical code contribution in any Ocean Protocol repository would go as follows:

1. As an external developer, fork the respective repo and push to your own fork. Ocean core developers push directly on the repo under `oceanprotocol` org.
2. Work in feature branches, for naming use `feature/your-feature` or `feature/23` for new features and `fix/your-fix` or `fix/23` for bug fixes, referring to the issue number.
3. To get visibility and feedback as early as possible open your Pull Request as a `Draft`.
4. Give it a meaningful title, and at least link to the respective issue in the Pull Request description, like `closes #23`
5. Once your Pull Request is ready, mark it as `Ready for Review`, in most repositories code owners are automatically notified and asked for review.
6. Get all CI checks green and address eventual change requests.
7. Once a Pull Request is approved, you can merge it.

Except for GitHub, you can find most Ocean Protocol core developers in [Discord](https://discord.gg/TnXjkR5) if you have further development questions.

## Develop an app or integration, using Ocean as a tool

Integrate Ocean at one of its interface points: React hooks, Javascript library, Python library, smart contracts, etc.

Ocean documentation will help. And... you're here:)

## Report a bug

To report a vulnerability, [go here](/concepts/vulnerabilities/).

To report a bug that isn't a vulnerability, go to the relevant GitHub repository, click on the Issues tab, click on the New issue button, and read the instructions.

## Improve these docs

These docs can always be improved. Here's the repo.
