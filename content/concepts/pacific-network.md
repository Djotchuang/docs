title: The Pacific Network
description: An introduction to the Pacific Network.
---

**At the time of writing, there was no live, running, publicly-available Pacific Network.**

You can use the Ocean Protocol in several EVM-compatible networks, including:

- the Ethereum Mainnet (also called the Main Ethereum Network),
- various [testnets](/concepts/testnets/), and
- in the future, the Pacific Network.

The Pacific Network will be an EVM-compatible network of nodes ("keepers") running [Parity Ethereum](https://www.parity.io/ethereum/) software. Various Ocean Protocol smart contracts ("keeper contracts") will be deployed to it.

The Pacific Network is (or was) also known by other names, including:

- Pacific
- The Main Ocean Network
- The Ocean Mainnet
- The Ocean Live Network

"Network" is sometimes shortened to just "Net."

Initially, all the nodes in the Pacific Network will be operated solely by BigchainDB GmbH (i.e. one company), but the goal is for the nodes to be operated by many independent operators in the future.

Initially, the Pacific Network will not be production-ready, that is, it will not be suitable for production use cases.
We expect vulnerabilities to be discovered and will conduct security audits over time, but the Ocean Protocol smart contracts will be in the wild for all intents and purposes.
Over time, the Pacific Network will be upgraded and improved.
There is no intent to shut it down.
Eventually, the goal is for it to become production-ready.

[Ocean Tokens](/concepts/ocean-tokens/) can, in principle, live in any EVM-compatible network. The ones sold in the Ocean Protocol token sale were in the Ethereum Mainnet. There will be a token bridge between the Ethereum Mainnet and the Pacific Network, allowing anyone with Ocean Tokens to move them from the Ethereum Mainnet to the Pacific Network. However, please be aware that doing so would put those Ocean Tokens at risk. For more information, see [the page about Ocean Tokens](/concepts/ocean-tokens/).
