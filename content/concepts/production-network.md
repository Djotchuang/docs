description: An introduction to the Ocean Production Network.
---

**At the time of writing, there was no live, running, publicly-available Ocean Production Network.**

Ocean Protocol makes use of several EVM networks, including:

- the Ethereum Mainnet (also called the Main Ethereum Network),
- various [testnets](/concepts/testnets/), and
- in the future, the Ocean Production Network.

The Ocean Production Network will be an EVM network of nodes ("keepers") running [Parity Ethereum](https://www.parity.io/ethereum/) software.  Various Ocean Protocol smart contracts ("keeper contracts") will be deployed to it. It will be used for production use cases. It is also known by other names, including:

- The Main Ocean Network
- The Ocean Mainnet
- The Ocean Live Network
- (among the internal dev team) The Ocean Pacific Network, or just Pacific

"Network" is sometimes shortened to just "Net."

[Ocean Tokens](/concepts/ocean-tokens/) can, in principle, live in any EVM network. The ones sold in the Ocean Protocol token sale were in the Ethereum Mainnet (and still were, at the time of writing). For more information, see [the page about Ocean Tokens](/concepts/ocean-tokens/).
