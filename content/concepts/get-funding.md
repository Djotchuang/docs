Funding can be for contributing to the core software, building apps, doing integrations, fixing bugs, community outreach, and more.

Here are two options for getting funding.

- You can make a funding proposal [here](https://www.oceanprotocol.com/fund).
- Or, go for a pre-defined [bounty on Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/explorer?network=mainnet&idx_status=open&keywords=oceanprotocol&order_by=-web3_created&org=oceanprotocol)
