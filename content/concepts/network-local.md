You can deploy Ocean onto Ganache - a local Ethereum "network" that you run on your machine for fast iterations while developing your app.

Barge is a shell script to help with Ocean Ganache deployments. It launches Docker and Docker Compose, to run Ganache with Ocean smart contracts on top, along with Provider and Aquarius metadata cache. It's used extensively by the Ocean core devs.

The [Connect-to-Networks](/tutorials/connect-to-networks/) tutorial has more information about connecting your wallet or app to Ganache / Barge.
