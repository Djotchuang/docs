## üê≥ Developers: Barge

Developers can run and try every [Ocean software component](/concepts/components/) on their local machine, all at once, using Docker Compose. Ocean Protocol software developers do this often, to test their code against all the other Ocean components.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oceanprotocol/barge.git
cd barge/
./start_ocean.sh
```

Seeing the dolphin means it's working:

Once everything is up and running, you can interact with the components. E.g. once [Pleuston](/concepts/components/#pleuston) is running, you can interact with it at:

- [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

For the details of what components are running, see the [`barge` repository](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/barge).

## üë©‚Äçüî¨ Data Science: Jupyter notebooks

You can try some free, online Jupyter notebooks that connect to a live Ocean test network.
