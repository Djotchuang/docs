## Option 1

You can [try some free, online Jupyter notebooks](/tutorials/jupyter-notebooks/) that connect to a live Ocean test network.

## Option 2

You can run and try every [Ocean software component](/concepts/components/) in your local machine, all at once, using Docker Compose. Ocean Protocol software developers do this often, to test their code against all the other Ocean components.

The Docker Compose files–and instructions to use them–are in [the Barge repository on GitHub](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/barge).
