title: API References
description: 
---

This section has API reference docs (or links to external ones) for the following Ocean Protocol components and libraries:

<repo name="ocean.js"></repo>
<repo name="react"></repo>
<repo name="ocean.py"></repo>
<repo name="ocean-contracts"></repo>
<repo name="aquarius"></repo>
<repo name="provider-py"></repo>

The API references for Aquarius and Provider-py are auto-generated from the Swagger specs (JSON files) of the live instances. On this site you can't execute the documented API calls yet. If you need that, you can run a component's local Swagger UI as outlined in the repository instructions on GitHub.
Additionally, if you need API docs for a past version of Aquarius or Provider-py, check out their specs on SwaggerHub:

- [SwaggerHub: Aquarius](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/Ocean-Protocol/aquarius)
- [SwaggerHub: Provider-py](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/Ocean-Protocol/provider-py)
