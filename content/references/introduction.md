title: API References
description: All the API reference docs for Ocean Protocol components and libraries.
---

This section has API reference docs (or links to external ones) for the following Ocean Protocol components and libraries:

<repo name="aquarius"></repo>
<repo name="brizo"></repo>

Those are sourced from their respective Swagger specs. On this site you can't execute the documented API calls yet. If you need this, you can run a component's local Swagger UI as outlined in the repository instructions on GitHub.

Additionally, if you need API docs for a past version of Aquarius or Brizo, check out their specs on SwaggerHub:

- [SwaggerHub: Aquarius](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/Ocean-Protocol/aquarius)
- [SwaggerHub: Brizo](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/Ocean-Protocol/brizo)

References of all the functions and methods used in our libraries:

<repo name="squid-js"></repo>
<repo name="squid-py"></repo>
<repo name="squid-java"></repo>
