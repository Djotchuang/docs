title: API & Library References
description: All the references for Ocean Protocol components.

**Heads Up! This reference section is in heavy development and updated as we integrate data from various code reference tools into this site.**

The following components expose a consumable REST API which are documented on this site:

<repo name="aquarius"></repo>
<repo name="brizo"></repo>

Those are sourced from their respective Swagger specs. On this site you can't execute the documented API calls yet. If you need this, you can run a component's local Swagger UI as outlined in the repository instructions on GitHub.

References of all the functions and methods used in our libraries:

<repo name="squid-js"></repo>
<repo name="squid-py"></repo>
<repo name="squid-java"></repo>
