title: Get ETH and OCEAN Tokens
description: How to get tokens for each network deployment
---

### Overview

In each network, you'll need ETH to pay for gas. Certain Ocean actions will need OCEAN tokens.

The ETH and OCEAN in Ropsten and local networks are not "real" ETH or OCEAN tokens of any value. They're simply stand-ins to be able to test. 

### Ethereum mainnet

- **ETH.** [Here are exchanges](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum#markets) to purchase ETH. 

- **OCEAN.** [Here are exchanges](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ocean-protocol#markets) to purchase OCEAN.


### Ropsten testnet

Testnets like Ropsten have faucets to dole out ETH and OCEAN.

- **OCEAN.** [Here's an OCEAN faucet](fixme) for Ropsten (FIXME!!).

### Local network

Ganache is the local network. Ocean Barge is a tool to help use it.

- **ETH.** By default, Ganache creates several Ethereum accounts at launch, gives each some ETH, and makes their private keys available in the logs. You can also instruct Ganache to give ETH to specific Ethereum addresses.

- **OCEAN.** You can deploy an ERC20 token with label OCEAN. You'll see examples in the quickstarts for the Ocean JavaScript and Python drivers.
