title: Use Your Wallet to Manage Ocean Tokens
description: How to use crypto wallet software to check your Ocean Token balance and to send Ocean Tokens to others.
---

If you don't see any Ocean Tokens in your crypto wallet software (e.g. MetaMask or MyEtherWallet), don't worry! It might not know how to manage Ocean Tokens yet.

## Step 1: Determine the Ocean Token Contract Address in the Network You're Using

If you know the URL of a Brizo instance attached to the network you're using, then just go to that URL in your web browser and get the value of `contracts.OceanToken`.

### Kovan or Nile Testnet

| Testnet | Ocean Token Contract Address                 |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Kovan   | `0xB57C4D626548eB8AC0B82b086721516493E2908d` |
| Nile    | `0x9861Da395d7da984D5E8C712c2EDE44b41F777Ad` |

If the above addresses are out-of-date, then you can find newer ones in the [keeper-contracts repository on GitHub](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/keeper-contracts):

1. Click on the "Branch: **develop**" button and switch to the tag of the latest release (e.g. `v0.8.6`).
1. In the `README.md` file, check the address of the OceanToken contract (in Nile or Kovan).
1. Double-check the address by looking in the file named `zos.kovan.json` (for Kovan) or `zos.dev-8995.json` (for Nile). Search for `/OceanToken`. There should be one result and the text around it should look like:

   ```json
    "@oceanprotocol/keeper-contracts/OceanToken": [
      {
        "address": "0x9861Da395d7da984D5E8C712c2EDE44b41F777Ad",
   ```

   Compare the `"address"` value to the value from the `README.md` file.

### Spree or Ganache-Based Testnet

If you're using [Barge](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/barge) to run a local Spree Testnet or a local Ganache-based testnet, then you can get the address of the OceanToken contract by looking at the value of `"address"` in:

- `$HOME/.ocean/keeper-contracts/artifacts/OceanToken.spree.json` for Spree
- `$HOME/.ocean/keeper-contracts/artifacts/OceanToken.development.json` for Ganache

### Ethereum Mainnet

The Ocean Token contract address in the Ethereum Mainnet is:

`0x985dd3D42De1e256d09e1c10F112bCCB8015AD41`

### Pacific Network

The Ocean Token contract address in the [Pacific Network](/concepts/pacific-network/) is:

`0x012578f9381e876A9E2a9111Dfd436FF91A451ae`

## Step 2: Teach Your Wallet Software about Ocean Tokens

### MetaMask Instructions

1. Make sure MetaMask is connected to the correct network (Nile, Kovan or whatever). See [the tutorial about how to do that](/tutorials/connect-to-networks/).
1. For the account you want to manage, click the `â˜°` (hamburger menu icon).
1. Scroll down until the `Add Token` link is visible, then click on it.
1. Click on `Custom Token`.
1. Paste the OceanToken contract address (from Step 1 above) into the "Token Contract Address" field. The other two fields should auto-fill. If they don't then something is wrong.
1. Click `Next`.
1. Click `Add Tokens`.

MetaMask should now show your Ocean Token (OCEAN) balance, and when you're looking at that, there should be a `Send` button to send Ocean Tokens to others. For help with that, see [the MetaMask docs about how to send tokens](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015488931-How-to-Send-Tokens).
