title: Use Your Wallet to Manage Ocean Tokens
description: How to use crypto wallet software to check your Ocean Token balance and to send Ocean Tokens to others.

If you don't see any Ocean Tokens in your crypto wallet software (e.g. MetaMask or MyEtherWallet), don't worry! It might not know how to manage Ocean Tokens yet.

## Step 1: Determine the Ocean Token Contract Address in the Network You're Using

If you know the URL of a Brizo instance attached to the network you're using, then just go to that URL in your web browser and get the value of `contracts.OceanToken`.

### Ethereum Mainnet

The Ocean Token contract address in the Ethereum Mainnet is:

[`0xxxx`](https://etherscan.io/token/0xxxx)

### Pacific Network

The Ocean Token contract address in the [Pacific Network](/concepts/pacific-network/) is:

[`0x012578f9381e876A9E2a9111Dfd436FF91A451ae`](https://submarine.oceanprotocol.com/address/0x012578f9381e876a9e2a9111dfd436ff91a451ae/transactions)

### Nile Testnet

The Ocean Token contract address in the [Nile Testnet](/concepts/testnets/#the-nile-testnet) is:

[`0x9861Da395d7da984D5E8C712c2EDE44b41F777Ad`](https://submarine.nile.dev-ocean.com/address/0x9861Da395d7da984D5E8C712c2EDE44b41F777Ad)

### Spree or Ganache-Based Testnet

If you're using [Barge](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/barge) to run a local Spree Testnet or a local Ganache-based testnet, then you can get the address of the OceanToken contract by looking at the value of `"address"` in:

- `$HOME/.ocean/keeper-contracts/artifacts/OceanToken.spree.json` for Spree
- `$HOME/.ocean/keeper-contracts/artifacts/OceanToken.development.json` for Ganache

## Step 2: Teach Your Wallet Software about Ocean Tokens

### MetaMask Instructions

1. Make sure MetaMask is connected to the correct network (Pacific, Nile or whatever). See [the tutorial about how to do that](/tutorials/connect-to-networks/).
2. For the account you want to manage, click the `â˜°` (hamburger menu icon).
3. Scroll down until the `Add Token` link is visible, then click on it.
4. Click on `Custom Token`.
5. Paste the OceanToken contract address (from Step 1 above) into the "Token Contract Address" field. The other two fields should auto-fill. If they don't then something is wrong.
6. Click `Next`.
7. Click `Add Tokens`.

MetaMask should now show your Ocean Token (OCEAN) balance, and when you're looking at that, there should be a `Send` button to send Ocean Tokens to others. For help with that, see [the MetaMask docs about how to send tokens](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015488931-How-to-Send-Tokens).

### Other Wallet Software

Do a web search to find out how to add a custom ERC-20 token to the wallet software you're using.
