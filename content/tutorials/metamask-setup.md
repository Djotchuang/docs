## What is MetaMask?

[MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) is a browser extension that allows web applications to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. Today, web browsers like Chrome and Firefox display information by fetching it from a server. Our current web browsers (Web 2.0 as itâ€™s called) are not built to interface with distributed systems. MetaMask allows modern web browsers to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.

MetaMask serves a dual purpose as a [wallet](/concepts/wallets) (for Ether and ERC-20 tokens) and as a Web 3.0 browser. For users, it can work as an Ethereum wallet. For developers, it allows you to design and run Ethereum DApps right in your browser without running a full Ethereum node. MetaMask talks to the Ethereum blockchain for you.

## How to Set Up MetaMask for Chrome

**Note: MetaMask can also be used with a hardware wallet but we don't cover that option below.**

1. Go to the [Chrome Web Store for extensions](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions) and search for MetaMask.

2. Install MetaMask. It will get added as a browser extension in the top right corner of your browser. Read through and accept the terms and conditions. Create a username and password in the next step.

3. MetaMask will generate a secret backup phrase for you. Write it down, store it in a safe place, and click next.

5. Voila! Your account is now created. You can now manage Ether and Ocean Tokens with your wallet. You can copy your account address to clipboard from the options. When you want someone to send Ether or Ocean Tokens to you, you will have to give them that address. It's not a secret.
