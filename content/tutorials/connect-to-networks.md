## Connect to Ethereum mainnet

Ocean's on Ethereum mainnet, for production usage.

Metamask and other ERC20 wallets default to Ethereum mainnet. Therefore your wallet is almost certainly pointing to Ethereum by default.


## Connect to testnets

`Rinkeby` and `Ropsten` are prominent Ethereum test nets. Ocean is deployed to both.

To connect: In MetaMask, click on the network name dropdown, then select `Rinkeby` or `Ropsten`. That's it.

## For Developers
